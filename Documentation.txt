METHODS:

210 LOGIN	
	The LOGIN method means an attempt to for a client to log into the 
	server. The contents of the request includes an ID set by the user.

211 PLACE
	The PLACE method means an attempt for a client to place a piece on the
	tick-tac-toe board. The contents of the request includes the position 
	on the board in which the player wishes to place a piece on.

212 EXIT
	The EXIT method means that a client has exited from the game.
	
STATUS CODES:
	
200 OK
	The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response 
	is dependent on the method used in the request, for example:
	
	PLACE	the status of the newly updated tick-tac-toe board
	
213 WAIT
	The WAIT status code is used for two scenarios:
	1.	The login request is successful, but there are not enough players 
		to begin a match. The client must wait for a match to begin.
	2.	The client is participating in a match, but it is the other 
		player's turn to make a move. The client must wait for the other
		client to make a move before it can make one.
	
214 START
	This indicates that there are enough players to begin a match, and a
	match has begun.
